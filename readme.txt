Webarena is an website for an online game wich allows users to create fighters, developp their skills by fightings and developp a community, called "guild".

When a players subscribes, he has to create a fighter to be able to play.

Then, he can access several pages :
  - Fighter gives all the informations about the fighter,
  - Sight where he can play,
  - Diary, a page regrouping the history of all the actions that happened,
  - Guilds where the player can consult the list of all the existing guilds and join the on he wants.
  
 As the player fights, his fighter can acquire skills as strengh and sight.

* Option 1 :
The player is able to create a guild, join others and send messages to other fighters.

* Option 2 :

We can connect ourself via our Google Account, that's why we always have the form "Create a Fighter" with two options : 

- Create the fighter
- I already have a fighter

We have added the second option for the Google Account because we don't know when it's the first connection for the user. With these two option, it can directly go to the index.
We did not succeed the creation of a fighter for the connection with Google because we can't have the user id used for the player.

* Option 3 :

There are decoration elements in the game : columns, traps and monsters. A fighter cannot pass through a column. He can be killed by a trap or a monster, but he can attack them too.
