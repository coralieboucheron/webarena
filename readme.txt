* Option G :

We can connect ourself via our Google Account, that's why we always have the form "Create a Fighter" with two options : 

- Create the fighter
- I already have a fighter

We have added the second option for the Google Account because we don't know when it's the first connection for the user. With these two option, it can directly go to the index.
We did not succeed the creation of a fighter for the connection with Google because we can't have the user id used for the player.
